# Ari Harrison

**Architect of the Intelligence Layer**

I design intelligence infrastructure—the logic layers between foundation models and high-stakes decisions. Prediction infrastructure, compliance-aware tooling, and orchestration that turns conversation into computation.

## What I Do

I close the gap between AI reasoning and real-world action. I specialize in moving AI from "demo" to "production" by building the systems that handle failure, compliance, and scale automatically.

- **Strategic Focus** — Standardizing Contextual Intelligence & Orchestration
- **Infrastructure** — MCP Servers, Prediction Layers, HPC Clusters
- **Systemic Trust** — Automated Compliance, Self-Diagnosing Agents
- **Proven Scale** — Sub-50ms Latency at 100M+ Record Volume
